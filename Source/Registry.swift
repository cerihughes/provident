/// The registry works by registering a number of functions. To retrieve a VC, the Token is passed into all
/// registered functions along with an optional Context <C>. The context isn't "optional" in the traditional (C?)
/// sense - instead there are 2 creation functions - 1 that uses C, and one that doesn't. The 1st non-nil VC that comes
/// back is used as the return value.
///
/// Note that registrants should make sure they don't "overlap" - if more than 1 registrant could potentially return a
/// VC for the same token, functions that register with a context will return first, and if there are still multiple,
/// the function that was registered first will return first.
